JFS (Jan's Fuzzy System) is an open source fuzzy system developed in ANSI C.
It contains several command line tools for compiling, running, transforming
and improving programs written in the language Jfl. Those programs can be
written and modified with any standard text editor.

Along with the software there is also a manual available in HTML format. It
is, in fact, written in an internal format and converted afterwards to HTML
as part of the installation.

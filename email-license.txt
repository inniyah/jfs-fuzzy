Hi,

Regarding the license of JFS2.

The intension with the license was: you can use the program and its 
documentation any way you want, as long as you don't try to take control 
over (copyright) the program (I should y have releases it under a 
GNU-lincense). So the answer to your questions is:

> Does the license include permission to modify the code
> and redistribute the modified program?

Yes. You are welcome to modify the code and redistribute the modified code.

> Also, does this license covers the contents of
> jfsdoc204.tar.gz too?

Yes. You can use the documentation any way you want.

Best regards
Jan
